# Bad Drivers
<br>

Gameplay
======
The aim of the Game is simple enough. Use the buttons on screen to move the car around the playing area. You need to avoid the tractors and trucks as they move around the playing area. You can use the shoot button to shoot these obstacles for points by using the shoot button, the only stipulation is that you must be moving to shoot. Another feature of the game is that you will shoot in the direction you are moving. A number of bikes will follow you while you play, they will spawn and begin to follow you and you can gain upto five bikes on screen following you. The bikes now need to be protected as if they collide with an enemy object you will lose a heart. The players health is represented by a maximum of five hearts in the top left of the screen and will decrease everytime the player or a bike collides with the enemy objects. If the amount of hearts drops to zero then then player dies and is brought to the Game over screen. The only way a player can replenish hearts is by shooting or colliding with an ambulance. the ambulance will spawn and move into the Game area infrequently.
  
Scoring System
======
The Player will recieve 20 points for shooting a truck, 30 for a tractor and 50 for an ambulance. This will then be multiplied by the amount of bikes on screen and added to player score.
